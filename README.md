# Underground Economy of Nepal: An Estimation Using Currency Demand Approach and MIMIC Model

# A. Introduction

Ever wonder what's really going on beneath the surface of an economy? In Nepal, like many places, there's a whole world of economic activity happening outside the official records, the 'underground economy'. It's a bit like trying to understand a forest by only counting the tallest trees. We're missing a huge part of the picture. This project is about digging deeper, using some clever statistical tools (think of them as our economic magnifying glasses) to get a better sense of how big this hidden economy is, and how it impacts Nepal. We're talking about everything from informal businesses to unreported transactions, all the stuff that doesn't show up in the official numbers. By getting a clearer view of this, project aims to contribute to a more realistic understanding of Nepal's economy, and maybe even help find ways to make things fairer and more transparent.

# B. Problem Statement

The underground economy represents economic activities that exist physically in an economy but are not registered in national income and product accounts. These activities can range from illegal trade of drugs to income misrepresentation for tax avoidance. The existence of a significant underground economy poses several challenges:

- Inaccurate National Statistics: Official GDP figures underestimate the true size of economic activity, leading to misguided economic policies
- Tax Revenue Loss: Governments lose substantial tax revenue that could fund public services and infrastructure
- Market Distortion: Unregistered businesses may operate without adhering to regulations, creating unfair competition for legitimate enterprises
- Policy Ineffectiveness: Macroeconomic policies may be ineffective when based on incomplete economic data

This issue is particularly acute in developing countries like Nepal, where informal economic activities are prevalent. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), informal employment accounts for approximately 94.3% of total employment in Nepal. The Central Bureau of Statistics' National Economic Census indicates that 49.9% of establishments in Nepal are unregistered, employing about 25.8% of the workforce. However, despite its importance, there is limited research quantifying the size of Nepal's underground economy and identifying its key drivers over time.

This study addresses this critical gap by providing comprehensive estimates of Nepal's underground economy from 1991 to 2019 using established econometric methodologies. Understanding the size and determinants of the underground economy is essential for effective policy formulation and implementation in Nepal's development context.

# C. Research Objectives

This research aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. Quantitative Estimation: To estimate the size and evolution of Nepal's underground economy from 1991 to 2019 using two complementary approaches:

- Currency Demand Approach (CDA)
- Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model

2. Causal Factor Analysis: To identify and analyze the key factors contributing to the underground economy in Nepal, including:

- Tax burden
- Self-employment rates
- Unemployment levels
- Government expenditure patterns
- Financial system characteristics

3. International Financial Linkages: To investigate the relationship between the underground economy and Nepalese deposits in Swiss banks, examining whether increases in underground economic activity correlate with increased offshore banking activity

4. Policy Framework Development: To provide evidence-based policy recommendations for:

- Reducing the size of the underground economy
- Improving tax compliance
- Integrating informal economic activities into the formal sector
- Enhancing economic measurement accuracy

5. Methodological Contribution: To apply and compare multiple estimation techniques in the context of a developing economy, contributing to the methodological literature on measuring underground economic activity

# D. Literature and Conceptual Framework

## 1. Defining the Underground Economy

The underground economy (also called shadow economy, informal economy, or hidden economy) refers to economic activities that could be provided through registered market channels but occur through unregistered economic transactions. These activities include:

- Legal activities with tax evasion: Unreported income from self-employment, wages, and assets
- Legal activities with regulatory avoidance: Businesses operating without proper licenses or avoiding labor regulations
- Illegal activities: Smuggling, drug trafficking, and other criminal enterprises

## 2. Theoretical Framework

Several theoretical frameworks explain the existence and growth of underground economies:

- Tax Burden Theory: Higher taxation incentivizes tax evasion and drives economic activity underground
- Regulatory Burden Theory: Excessive regulations push businesses to operate informally
- Institutional Quality Theory: Weak institutions and corruption facilitate underground economic activities
- Labor Market Structure Theory: High unemployment and self-employment rates correlate with larger underground economies

## 3. Measurement Approaches

Various methods have been developed to estimate the size of underground economies:

### a. Direct approaches:

- Survey and questionnaire-based techniques
- Tax audits and compliance analyses
- National accounts discrepancy methods
- These approaches often suffer from response biases, as participants are reluctant to admit tax evasion or illegal activities

### b. Indirect approaches:

- Discrepancy methods: Comparing GDP measured by expenditure versus income approaches
- Labor market discrepancy: Analyzing differences between official and actual labor force participation
- Transactions approach: Using the quantity theory of money to estimate total economic activity
- Currency demand approach: Assuming underground transactions primarily use cash to avoid detection
- Physical input methods: Using electricity consumption or other physical inputs as proxies for economic activity

### c. Structural or modeling approach:

- MIMIC (Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes): Using structural equation modeling to estimate underground economy as a latent variable
- Dynamic General Equilibrium Models: Incorporating underground economy into macroeconomic models

## 4. Previous Studies on Nepal's Underground Economy

Limited research exists on Nepal's underground economy:

- Kanel (2018) estimated Nepal's underground economy at 37.5% of GDP using the currency demand approach
- Raut et al. (2016) found evidence of a growing underground economy in Nepal
- A report by the International Labor Organization (2019) indicated that informal employment accounts for 94.3% of total employment in Nepal

This study builds upon previous research by:

- Using multiple estimation methods for comparison and validation
- Employing a longer time series (1991-2019)
- Incorporating analysis of international financial flows
- Applying advanced econometric techniques including ARDL cointegration testing

# E. Methodology 

## 1. Research Design

This study employs causal research design to explain the cause-and-effect relationships between various indicators and causal variables of underground economic activity. The research utilizes two primary estimation approaches: the Currency Demand Approach (CDA) and the Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model. Additionally, regression analysis examines the relationship between the underground economy and Nepalese Swiss bank deposits.

## 2. Data Collection

The study uses annual time-series data spanning from 1991 to 2019. This timeframe was selected based on data availability constraints, as reliable data before 1991 was not consistently available for key variables. Data sources include:

- Nepal Rastra Bank's quarterly economic bulletins and annual reports
- Ministry of Finance economic surveys and reports
- World Bank Development Indicators Database
- International Monetary Fund statistics
- Central Bureau of Statistics publications

Key variables collected include:

- Currency in circulation
- Money supply measures (M1, M2)
- Tax revenue as percentage of GNP
- Household final consumption expenditure
- Interest rates on time deposits
- Per capita income
- Inflation rates
- Self-employment rates
- Unemployment rates
- Government expenditure
- Labor force participation rates
- Real GDP growth rates
- Nepalese deposits in Swiss banks

## 3. Model Specification 

### a. CDA model Specification: 

CC = a0 + a1 ln T + a2 ln (WS/NI) + a3 ln R + a4 ln Y + e
In the equation, the dependent variable is the ratio of currency holdings (C) to money (specified as M2). Real per capita income (Y), the rate of interest paid on time deposits (R), the wage-salary ratio in national income (WS/NI), and an income tax variable are the independent variables (T). 

Demand for money is calculated as: 
ln (C/M2)t = β0 + β 1 ln consumptiont  + β 2 ln interestt + β 3 ln taxt + β 4 ln percapitat + β5 ln inflationt + ut - (1)
with β1 > 0, β2 < 0, β3 > 0, β4 > 0

In the following equation, ln stands for natural logarithm, C/M2 is the ratio of cash holdings to current and deposit accounts, ln_tax is the government's total tax revenue per Gross National Product representing changes in the size of the shadow economy, and ln_consumption is the proportion of private consumption expenditure in national income to capture changing payment and money holding patterns, ln_interest is the rate of interest given on savings accounts to capture the opportunity cost of holding cash, ln_percapita is per capita income and ln_inflation is the inflation rate representing general price level.

The new equation with tax becomes the following from equation 1: 

CC t = β0 + β 1 ln consumptiont  + β 2 ln interestt + β 3 ln taxt + β 4 ln percapitat + β5 ln inflationt + ut - (2)

The new equation without tax becomes the following:

β0 + β 1 ln consumptiont  + β 2 ln interestt + β 3 ln percapitat + β5 ln inflationt + ut - (3)

Thus, excess currency demand (ECD) is calculated as follows:

ECD t = CC t - CC t≠0 – (4)

Where, CC t represents Currency Calculations with tax and CC t≠0 is Currency Calculations without tax. 

Illegal money (IM) is calculated by multiplying equation 4 by the M2 variable:

IM= ECD t * M2

Legal money (LM) is calculated using as:

LM= Narrow Money Supply (M1) – IM

Velocity (V) for the formal economy is calculated as: 

V= National Income (GNP)/ LM

Lastly, Underground Economy is calculated as:

UE= IM*V

The calculated IM is then presented as a percentage of GDP in the following sections of model estimations and analysis. 
Equation (2) is re-specified to use the ARDL model, whereby the variables Per Capita Income (Y/N)t and Interest rate (It) is removed from the equation. For the specifications of ARDL model and the Bound test, the study defines a vector of variables, Gt, where, Gt = (ct, bt’)’.  Here, ct is the dependent variable and bt’ is a vector of regressors. The data generating process of Gt is a p-order vector autoregression. 

For cointegration analysis ΔCCt must be modeled with the error correction form (ECM) in the model i.e., 

ΔCCt = β0 + πcc*ct-1 + πcb.b*bt-1 + ∑ ∂i*Δct-i + ∑ δj*Δbt-j + Ø*wt + ut (5)

where, πcc and πcb are long run multipliers, β0 is the drift term and wt is a vector of exogenous components. The bounds testing procedure tests for the absence of any level relationship between ct and bt through exclusion of the lagged levels variables ct-1 and bt-1 in the equation.

### b. MIMIC Model Specification: 

Part 1: Latent variable is linearly determined by a set of exogenous causal variables

𝜂=𝛾′𝜒+ς (6)

Where, χ is a vector of causal variables, γ is a vector of scalars, η is the latent variable (shadow economy) and ς is a structural disturbance term. 

Part 2: Links the shadow economy with the set of selected indicators

𝑦= 𝜆𝜂+ε (7)

Where, y is a vector of indicator variables, λ is a vector of loading factors to represent the magnitude of the expected change for a unit change in the latent variable η and ε is the measurement error term. 

After the SEM’s results of part 1 and 2 are obtained on the γ vector, the values are projected to fit the latent variable, which tracks the estimates of Underground economy in Nepal. For the benchmarking procedure, 1991/92 is taken as the base year. 

C = V/η and

UE = C* η (8)

Where, V is the benchmark value at time index, η  is the estimates obtained by MIMIC, UE is the benchmarked estimates. The methodologies for benchmarking differ in each, but they always boil down to two options. The benchmark value is obtained by multiplying or adding the corresponding element in the time series produced by MIMIC. In this investigation, the multiplication process is applied. 

Swiss Deposits Model: 

UE t = β0 + β 1 Swist + ut (9)

Where, Swis represents the Nepalese deposits in Swiss bank accounts and ut is the error term in the equation. A simple OLS regression and correlation analysis will be conducted for this model. 

## 4. Statistical Tests and Model Validation

Several statistical tests are performed to ensure model validity:

- Stationarity Testing: Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests examine unit roots in time series variables
- Multicollinearity Analysis: Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) tests check for collinearity between explanatory variables
- Cointegration Testing: Bounds test applied after the ARDL model to test for long-run relationships
- Model Significance: Wald tests examine overall model significance

# F. Results and Analysis

## 1. Descriptive Statistics

The data collected for Nepal from 1991 to 2019 showed significant variations in key macroeconomic indicators:

- Average tax revenue as percentage of GNP: 10.8%
- Mean inflation rate: 7.9%
- Average household consumption as percentage of GDP: 82.6%
- Mean unemployment rate: 4.2%
- Average self-employment rate: 69.3%

## 2. Stationarity and Model Specification

Results of Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests revealed:

- All variables were stationary at first difference (I(1)) except for log_interest
- Due to stationarity issues and multicollinearity concerns, the variables log_percapita and log_interest were excluded from the final models
- ARDL model was selected due to its ability to handle mixed integration orders among variables

## 3. Currency Demand Approach Findings

### a. Short-Run Estimates

- Model with Tax Variables:
        - R-squared: 0.88
        - Adjusted R-squared: 0.74
        - All variables significant at 5% level

- Coefficient signs:
        - log_consumption: -0.79 (negative impact on C/M2)
        - log_inflation: 0.07 (positive impact on C/M2)
        - log_tax: 0.32 (positive impact on C/M2)

- Model without Tax Variables:
        - R-squared: 0.17
        - Adjusted R-squared: 0.10
        - Only consumption significant at 5% level
        - Lower explanatory power compared to the model with tax variables

### b. Long-Run ARDL Results

- Bounds Test F-statistic: 10.109 (significant at 5% level)
- Variables log_consumption, log_inflation, and log_tax significant at 5% level
- Long-run coefficients:
        - log_consumption: 1.44 (positive impact on currency demand)
        - log_inflation: -0.38 (negative impact on currency demand)
        - log_tax: -0.54 (negative impact on currency demand)
- Despite the conventional assumption that tax increases underground economy, in Nepal's context, tax appears to reduce UE in the long run

### c. Underground Economy Trends (CDA Approach)

Analysis of the estimated underground economy in Nepal revealed several patterns:

- Early 1990s: UE was relatively stable at approximately 25-30% of GNP
- Mid-1990s: Sharp increase to around 50% of GNP, coinciding with the beginning of the Maoist insurgency (1996)
- Late 1990s to early 2000s: Decline to 30-40% range
- 2000s to 2014/15: Steady rising trend reaching approximately 60% of GNP
- 2015/16: Significant spike to over 70% of GNP following the 2015 earthquake and subsequent Indian blockade
- 2016/17 to 2018/19: Slight moderation but remaining at elevated levels above 60% of GNP

The comparison between legal money (LM) and illegal money (IM) showed that LM consistently exceeded IM throughout most of the period, though the gap narrowed during periods of economic and political instability.

## 4. MIMIC Model Results

The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) estimates after 200 iterations revealed:

### a. Causal Variables:

- Tax: positive coefficient (0.88), significant at 5% level
- Self-employment: positive coefficient (8.27), significant at 1% level
- Unemployment: positive coefficient (2.34), significant at 1% level
- Recurrent government expenditure: negative coefficient (-4.97), significant at 1% level

### b. Model Fit:

- Wald test for UE: p-value = 0.0134 (significant at 5% level)
- Chi-square test: p-value = 0.0000 (significant at 1% level)

These results indicate that tax burden, self-employment, and unemployment positively contribute to the underground economy, while government expenditure has a negative impact. The negative coefficient for government expenditure suggests that higher public spending may reduce incentives for underground economic activity, potentially by providing better public services and social safety nets.

## 5. Comparison of CDA and MIMIC Estimates

Both models yielded similar trends in the underground economy, though MIMIC estimates were generally higher than CDA estimates:

- CDA average (1991-2019): 47.2% of GNP
- MIMIC average (1991-2019): 52.6% of GNP

The correlation between the two series was 0.83, indicating strong consistency between different estimation approaches. Key differences were observed during:

- The mid-1990s insurgency period (higher MIMIC estimates)
- The post-2015 earthquake period (higher CDA estimates)

These differences may reflect varying sensitivities of the models to different types of economic shocks.

## 6. Swiss Bank Deposits and Underground Economy

Analysis of the relationship between the Nepalese deposits in Swiss banks and the underground economy from 2001/02 to 2018/19 revealed:

- Average Nepalese deposits in Swiss banks: Rs. 16.22 billion
- Average underground economy: 55.49% of GNP

Regression results:

- R-squared: 0.62
- Adjusted R-squared: 0.59
- Coefficient on Swiss deposits: 0.74 (positive and significant at 5% level)

The model indicates that 59% of the variations in UE can be explained by Nepalese deposits in Swiss bank accounts. The significant positive relationship suggests that as underground economic activity increases, so does the parking of illicit money in Swiss accounts, likely for tax evasion purposes or to hide illicit income.
The trend analysis shows a particularly sharp increase in Swiss deposits corresponding with periods of higher UE growth, especially following the 2015 earthquake and economic blockade.

# G. Discussion

## 1. Interpretation of Key Findings

- Rising Underground Economy Trend: The consistent upward trend in Nepal's underground economy from 1991 to 2019 suggests that despite various policy reforms and regulatory changes, the fundamental drivers of informal economic activity have not been effectively addressed. This rising trend aligns with findings from other developing economies with similar institutional characteristics.
- Impact of Economic and Political Shocks: The pronounced increases in UE during periods of instability (Maoist insurgency, 2015 earthquake and blockade) highlight how economic and political shocks can drive economic activity underground. During periods of uncertainty, businesses and individuals may shift to informal channels due to:
        - Disruption of formal market mechanisms
        - Weakened institutional oversight
        - Survival strategies in response to economic hardship
        - Opportunistic behavior exploiting regulatory gaps
- Long-Term Tax Effects: The ARDL results indicating a negative long-run relationship between tax and currency demand contradict conventional assumptions about taxation driving underground economy growth. This suggests that in Nepal's context:
        - Higher tax revenue may reflect improved tax administration rather than higher tax rates
        - Tax collection may correspond with stronger overall governance
        - The relationship between taxation and UE may be non-linear or context-dependent
- Self-Employment and Underground Economy: The strong positive relationship between self-employment and UE (coefficient 8.27 in MIMIC model) reflects Nepal's labor market structure, where self-employment often operates outside regulatory frameworks. This suggests that policies targeting the formalization of self-employed workers could significantly reduce the UE.
- Swiss Deposits Connection: The strong correlation between UE and Swiss bank deposits indicates capital flight and potential money laundering concerns. This finding has important implications for Nepal's anti-money laundering policies and international financial cooperation efforts.

## 2. Theoretical Implications

The findings contribute to theoretical understanding of underground economies in several ways:

- Dual Economy Theory: The results support the concept of developing economies operating as dual systems with formal and informal sectors operating in parallel but interconnected ways.
- Institutional Quality Theory: The increase in UE during periods of institutional weakness (insurgency, political instability) supports theories linking institutional quality to underground economic activity.
- Economic Development Path: The persistent high levels of UE despite economic growth suggests that development does not automatically reduce informality without targeted structural and institutional reforms.
- Financial Intermediation Theory: The connection between UE and Swiss deposits indicates that weak domestic financial institutions may contribute to capital flight from underground activities.

## 3. Practical Implications

The findings have several practical implications for policymakers, businesses, and researchers:

- Statistical Accuracy: Official GDP figures likely underestimate Nepal's true economic size by 47-53%, implying that macroeconomic policies based solely on official statistics may be miscalibrated.
- Policy Targeting: The different factors influencing UE suggest that a multi-pronged approach is needed, addressing tax administration, labor market formalization, and financial system transparency simultaneously.
- Crisis Response: The tendency for UE to spike during crises should inform disaster response planning and economic stabilization policies.
- International Cooperation: The Swiss bank deposits connection highlights the need for enhanced international cooperation on tax transparency and anti-money laundering efforts.

# H. Conclusions and Policy Implications

## 1. Summary of Key Findings

- Nepal's underground economy has shown a persistent increasing trend from 1991/92 to 2018/19, ranging from approximately 25% to over 70% of GNP depending on the period and estimation method.
- Major economic and political shocks correspond with significant increases in underground economic activity, indicating the vulnerability of Nepal's formal economic structures during crises.
- Tax burden, self-employment, and unemployment are significant drivers of underground economic activity, while government expenditure appears to have a mitigating effect.
- A strong positive relationship exists between the underground economy and Nepalese deposits in Swiss banks, suggesting capital flight from underground activities.
- Despite various reform efforts, Nepal's underground economy continues to represent a substantial portion of total economic activity, highlighting the challenges of formalization in a developing economy context.

## 2. Policy Recommendations

Based on the empirical findings, the following policy recommendations are proposed:

- Tax System Reform
        - Simplify Tax Procedures: Reduce compliance costs for small businesses and self-employed individuals
        - Progressive Taxation: Design tax systems that reduce burden on lower-income groups while maintaining revenue collection
        - Tax Administration Modernization: Invest in technological infrastructure for tax collection to reduce avoidance opportunities
        - Taxpayer Education: Implement awareness campaigns about tax compliance benefits and social impact of tax evasion

- Labor Market Formalization
        - Simplified Registration: Create streamlined business registration procedures for informal enterprises
        - Targeted Incentives: Develop specific incentives for self-employed workers to formalize their activities
        - Social Protection: Extend social security benefits to informal sector workers to incentivize formalization
        - Skills Development: Provide training programs to improve productivity and earnings in formal employment

- Financial System Development
        - Financial Inclusion: Expand access to formal financial services for underserved populations
        - Digital Payment Systems: Promote cashless transactions to reduce anonymity of cash transactions
        -Banking the Unbanked: Develop financial products specifically designed for informal sector participants
        - Anti-Money Laundering: Strengthen regulatory frameworks to prevent illicit financial flows

- Institutional Strengthening
        - Anti-Corruption Measures: Implement transparent governance practices to reduce corruption incentives
        - Regulatory Quality: Review and streamline regulations to reduce compliance burdens while maintaining standards
        - Legal Framework: Strengthen property rights and contract enforcement to increase formal economy benefits
        - Public Service Delivery: Improve quality and accessibility of public services to enhance state legitimacy

- Crisis Preparedness
        - Economic Safety Nets: Develop robust social protection systems that can activate during crises
        - Formalization Pathways: Create expedited pathways for informal businesses to temporarily formalize during crises
        - Financial Support: Design emergency financial support mechanisms that can reach both formal and informal sectors

# I. Business Implications

The findings have several implications for businesses operating in Nepal:

- Market Size Assessment: Businesses should consider the substantial underground economy when evaluating market opportunities
- Competition Analysis: Formal businesses compete with informal enterprises that may have lower compliance costs
- Supply Chain Management: Businesses may need to develop strategies for engaging with suppliers operating partially in the informal economy
- Risk Management: Operating in environments with large underground economies requires specific risk mitigation strategies
- Financial Services: Financial institutions can develop products specifically targeting the transition from informal to formal financial behavior

# J. Limitations and Future Research Directions

## 1. Limitations

- Data Constraints: Limited availability and quality of data, particularly for earlier periods and for some variables
- Methodological Limitations: Indirect measurement approaches have inherent limitations and assumptions
- Structural Changes: The models may not fully capture structural economic changes over the 28-year period
- Underground Economy Composition: The study does not distinguish between different types of underground activities (tax evasion, illegal activities, etc.)

## 2. Future Research Directions

- Sectoral Analysis: Investigate which economic sectors have the highest underground activity rates
- Regional Variation: Examine geographic differences in underground economic activity within Nepal
- Policy Impact Evaluation: Assess the effectiveness of specific formalization policies
- Comparative Analysis: Compare Nepal's underground economy patterns with other South Asian countries
- Technological Impact: Investigate how digital payment systems and fintech are affecting underground economic activities
- Post-2019 Trends: Extend the analysis to include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Nepal's underground economy

Nepal's underground economy appears to have expanded in response to a series of significant disruptions, including the Maoist insurgency in the late 1990s, the 2008 housing bubble, the devastating 2015 earthquake and economic blockade, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. This growth is also implicated in the increasing flow of Nepalese deposits into Swiss bank accounts, as our analysis suggests. Political instability, a lack of security, and inadequate government services likely contribute to individuals and businesses operating outside the formal economy and transferring currency abroad. While regulatory bodies and enforcement agencies have been empowered to combat money laundering, progress remains limited, with political figures and economic offenders often deeply involved in illicit financial activities.

It's crucial to understand that reducing the underground economy doesn't mean targeting vulnerable individuals like street vendors. Rather, it necessitates integrating informal economic activities into the formal system. Authorities should implement campaigns to raise awareness about the benefits of adhering to legal guidelines for the broader public good. Conversely, the underground economy can foster market development, mobilize financial resources, stimulate entrepreneurship, and drive necessary reforms in legal, social, and economic institutions. Allowing for a voluntary transition between formal and informal sectors could enhance economic growth, potentially leading to a positive correlation between the growth of the informal sector and overall economic expansion.

Furthermore, the government must re-evaluate its tax policies, which can negatively impact social and economic conditions. Commercial banks should also reconsider their lending practices to create an investment-friendly environment that encourages savings deposits.
